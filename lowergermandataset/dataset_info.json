And while there have been some recent attempts to manually curate the amount of data necessary to train large language models, the main way to obtain this data is still through automatic web crawling. In this paper we take the existing multilingual web corpus OSCAR and its pipeline Ungoliant that extracts and classifies data from Common Crawl at the line level, and propose a set of improvements and automatic annotations in order to produce a new document-oriented version of OSCAR that could prove more suitable to pre-train large generative language models as well as hopefully other applications in Natural Language Processing and Digital Humanities.\",\n}\n@inproceedings{AbadjiOrtizSuarezRomaryetal.2021,\n  author    = {Julien Abadji and Pedro Javier Ortiz Su{'a}rez and Laurent Romary and Beno{\\^i}t Sagot},\n  title     = {Ungoliant: An optimized pipeline for the generation of a very large-scale multilingual web corpus},\n  series = {Proceedings of the Workshop on Challenges in the Management of Large Corpora (CMLC-9) 2021.

However, most of these large raw corpora are either available only for English or not available to the general public due to copyright issues. Nevertheless, there are some examples of freely available multilingual corpora for training Deep Learning NLP models, such as the OSCAR and Paracrawl corpora. However, they have quality issues, especially for low-resource languages. Moreover, recreating or updating these corpora is very complex. In this work, we try to reproduce and improve the goclassy pipeline used to create the OSCAR corpus. We propose a new pipeline that is faster, modular, parameterizable, and well documented. We use it to create a corpus similar to OSCAR but larger and based on recent data. Also, unlike OSCAR, the metadata information is at the document level. We release our pipeline under an open source license and publish the corpus under a research-only license.},\n  language  = {en}\n}\n@article{kreutzer-etal-2022-quality,\n    title = \"Quality at a Glance: An Audit of Web-Crawled Multilingual Datasets\",\n    author = {Kreutzer, Julia  and\n      Caswell, Isaac  and\n      Wang, Lisa  and\n      Wahab, Ahsan  and\n      van Esch, Daan  and\n      Ulzii-Orshikh, Nasanbayar  and\n      Tapo, Allahsera  and\n      Subramani, Nishant  and\n      Sokolov, Artem  and\n      Sikasote, Claytone  and\n      Setyawan, Monang  and\n      Sarin, Supheakmungkol  and\n      Samb, Sokhar  and\n      Sagot, Beno{\\^\\i}t  and\n      Rivera, Clara  and\n      Rios, Annette  and\n      Papadimitriou, Isabel  and\n      Osei, Salomey  and\n      Suarez, Pedro Ortiz  and\n      Orife, Iroro  and\n      Ogueji, Kelechi  and\n      Rubungo, Andre Niyongabo  and\n      Nguyen, Toan Q.  and\n      M{\"u}ller, Mathias  and\n      M{\"u}ller, Andr{'e}  and\n      Muhammad, Shamsuddeen Hassan  and\n      Muhammad, Nanda  and\n      Mnyakeni, Ayanda  and\n      Mirzakhalov, Jamshidbek  and\n      Matangira, Tapiwanashe  and\n      Leong, Colin  and\n      Lawson, Nze  and\n      Kudugunta, Sneha  and\n      Jernite, Yacine  and\n      Jenny, Mathias  and\n      Firat, Orhan  and\n      Dossou, Bonaventure F.

Lower-resource corpora have systematic issues: At least 15 corpora have no usable text, and a significant fraction contains less than 50{\\%} sentences of acceptable quality. In addition, many are mislabeled or use nonstandard/ambiguous language codes. We demonstrate that these issues are easy to detect even for non-proficient speakers, and supplement the human audit with automatic analyses. Finally, we recommend techniques to evaluate and improve multilingual corpora and discuss potential risks that come with low-quality data releases.\",\n}\n@inproceedings{ortiz-suarez-etal-2020-monolingual,\n    title = \"A Monolingual Approach to Contextualized Word Embeddings for Mid-Resource Languages\",\n    author = \"Ortiz Su{'a}rez, Pedro Javier  and\n      Romary, Laurent  and\n      Sagot, Benoit\",\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\",\n    month = jul,\n    year = \"2020\",\n    address = \"Online\",\n    publisher = \"Association for Computational Linguistics\",\n    url = \"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.156\",\n    pages = \"1703--1714\",\n    abstract = \"We use the multilingual OSCAR corpus, extracted from Common Crawl via language classification, filtering and cleaning, to train monolingual contextualized word embeddings (ELMo) for five mid-resource languages.

We show that, despite the noise in the Common-Crawl-based OSCAR data, embeddings trained on OSCAR perform much better than monolingual embeddings trained on Wikipedia. They actually equal or improve the current state of the art in tagging and parsing for all five languages. In particular, they also improve over multilingual Wikipedia-based contextual embeddings (multilingual BERT), which almost always constitutes the previous state of the art, thereby showing that the benefit of a larger, more diverse corpus surpasses the cross-lingual benefit of multilingual embedding architectures.\",\n}\n@inproceedings{OrtizSuarezSagotRomary2019,\n  author    = {Pedro Javier {Ortiz Su{'a}rez} and Benoit Sagot and Laurent Romary},\n  title     = {Asynchronous pipelines for processing huge corpora on medium to low resource infrastructures},\n  series = {Proceedings of the Workshop on Challenges in the Management of Large Corpora (CMLC-7) 2019.

Even though each document has a metadata block associated to it, this data lacks any information about the language in which each document is written, making it extremely difficult to use Common Crawl for monolingual applications. We propose a general, highly parallel, multithreaded pipeline to clean and classify Common Crawl by language; we specifically design it so that it runs efficiently on medium to low resource infrastructures where I/O speeds are the main constraint. We develop the pipeline so that it can be easily reapplied to any kind of heterogeneous corpus and so that it can be parameterised to a wide range of infrastructures. We also distribute a 6.3TB version of Common Crawl, filtered, classified by language, shuffled at line level in order to avoid copyright issues, and ready to be used for NLP applications.},\n  language  = {en}\n}\n",
